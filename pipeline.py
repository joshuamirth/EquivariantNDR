def prominent_cocycle(D,q=2,epsilon=1e-3):
    """Primary cocycle from H_1 persistence for lens coordinate
    representation.

    Computes the Vietoris-Rips persistent homology of a dataset
    (provided as a distance matrix) and returns the most persistent H_1
    cocycle. Also checks that this cocycle is sufficiently long to
    provide a valid lens coordinate classifying map and returns the
    corresponding covering radius.

    Parameters
    ----------
    D : ndarray (n*n)
        Distance matrix. Must be square. Symmetry, non-negativity, and
        triangle inequality are not enforced, but violations may lead to
        unexpected results.
    q : int, optional
        Coefficient field in which to compute homology. Must be prime.
        Default is 2.
    epsilon : Tolerance for covering radius. Default is 0.001. The
        persistent cocycle must die after 2*birth + epsilon to be valid.
    # TODO: understand exactly what epsilon does.

    Returns
    -------
    eta : ndarray (?)
        Representative of the most persistent H_1 cocycle in the
        Vietorisâ€“Rips persistent homology of D.
    valid_class : bool
        Whether the cohomology class if persistent enough to produce a
        valid classifying map. If false the data may lack any H_1
        cocycles or a different coefficient field may be required.
        

    Raises
    ------
    HomologyError
        If there are no persistent H_1 cocycles at all.
