# Summary of Experiments

Datasets:
* Line images, a model of $\RP^2$.
* Colored line images, a model of $\RP^3$.
* Point light-source images, a model of $\CP^1$.
* The flat Klein bottle. (Or the image version?)
* A curve in the space of line images.


We compare the following methods on each dataset:
* Classical PCA/MDS,
* Projective PCA (iterative),
* Projective PCA (batch),
* Projective MDS, which has the following variations:
    - True geodesic metric, with random and PCA initial conditions.
    - Squared geodesic metric, with random and PCA initial conditions.
    - True chordal metric, with random and PCA initial conditions.
    - Squared chordal metric, with random and PCA initial conditions.

The comparison metrics used are the following:
* Minimum dimension in which correct topology could be achieved. For some methods/datasets there will be no such dimension. Classical PCA should be the baseline here.
* Metric distortion in goal dimension, as `||D - D_G|| / ||D_G||`.
* Accuracy of topology in goal dimension (qualitatively via persistence diagrams, and quantified by bottleneck/Wasserstein distance computations when appropriate). This may not be necessary since I expect that getting the correct topology in the goal dimension is an either/or outcome and metric distortion is more useful than bottleneck distances.
* Execution time of algorithm. This is primarily for the true/squared MDS methods. Should also record required number of iterations. If true is significantly better on other metrics we may just ignore squared methods rendering this useless.

# Klein Bottle

Files:
* `klein_bottle_experiment.ipynb`

This is an example for _real projective MDS_. The basic data set is the flat
model of the Klein bottle.

The pipeline for this example is as follows:
* Generate data on the flat Klein bottle.
* Compute persistence of a landmark subset thereof.
* Map into `RP^N` where `N` is the number of landmarks.
* Reduce dimension to `RP^2` using PPCA.
* Optimize with MDS.

In principle this example could also be used to illustrate coordinates in `L_4`
by applying a lift to the cohomology classes into `Z_4`. There is theory to
suggest there should be a nice embedding there.

## Conclusions:

### PCA:
Reasonable embedding requires Euclidean dimension eight or higher. Six looks okay, but seven is weird. Pretty stable with eight and above. Quantitative measures of difference not reasonable.

### Projective PCA:
Embeddings look good. They recover the MÃ¶bius band, as hoped for on RP2. Both iterative and batch get about the same result.

## MDS

Story is that we can perform gradient descent directly, but may achieve equal quality results with some small approximations that hopefully improve performance significantly.

Dimension refers to the ambient dimension. Projective space is one less.
